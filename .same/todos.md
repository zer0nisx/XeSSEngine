# XeSSEngine Analysis & Fixes

## Current Issues
- [x] Missing Rendering directory in CMakeLists.txt
- [x] Verify if all basic_sample_super_resolution_dx11 knowledge was applied
- [x] Check project structure completeness
- [x] Review XeSS integration implementation
- [x] Fix CMake configuration errors

## Analysis Tasks
- [x] Compare with basic_sample_super_resolution_dx11 to see what's missing
- [x] Review XeSSContext implementation
- [x] Check if all necessary components are implemented
- [x] Verify resource management

## Fixes Needed
- [x] Fix CMakeLists.txt structure
- [x] Create missing directories if needed
- [x] Ensure proper XeSS initialization
- [x] Verify resource management

## New Enhancement: Shader Model 6.4 Support
- [x] Create ShaderCompiler module for modern shader compilation
- [x] Add DirectX Shader Compiler (DXC) integration
- [x] Implement shader cache system
- [x] Add support for Shader Model 6.0-6.4 features
- [x] Create example shaders showcasing SM 6.4 features
- [x] Add Wave Intrinsics support and examples
- [x] Add Variable Rate Shading example
- [x] Create performance comparison system
- [ ] Integrate with Graphics pipeline
- [ ] Add root signature generation
- [ ] Implement shader reflection capabilities
- [ ] Add shader hot-reload functionality

## Graphics Pipeline Integration Tasks
- [ ] Create modern Shader class with SM 6.4 support
- [ ] Integrate ShaderCompiler with Device class
- [ ] Create ShaderManager for automatic compilation and caching
- [ ] Update existing Graphics classes to use new shader system
- [ ] Implement automatic shader recompilation on file changes
- [ ] Create PipelineState management for modern shaders
- [ ] Add shader reflection integration for automatic resource binding
- [ ] Update XeSSContext to use modern shaders

## Completed Features
- ✓ Shader Model 6.4 compilation with DXC
- ✓ Wave Intrinsics showcases (parallel reductions, filtering)
- ✓ Variable Rate Shading examples with motion/foveation
- ✓ Advanced XeSS upscaling shader with SM 6.4 optimizations
- ✓ Intelligent shader caching system
- ✓ Legacy fallback to D3DCompiler for SM 5.x
- ✓ Comprehensive example and performance testing
